setup.py fo dev-cli

This script is used to package and distribute the azzy-cli project.
It includes details like the package name, version, dependencies, 
and entry points, making it easy to install and use as a command-line tool.

Key features of this setup.py file:
- Defines the package name and version.
- Lists required dependencies (like the Click library).
- Specifies the command-line entry point, allowing the 'azzy-cli' command to be used in the terminal.
- Enables installation in development mode (editable mode) with `pip install -e .`.

Running `python setup.py install` or `pip install -e .` allows users to install 
the azzy-cli package and make the azzy-cli command available globally.

This file should be included in version control (e.g., Git) since it is essential for 
package installation and distribution, but the generated `*.egg-info/` directories 
should be excluded from version control.
